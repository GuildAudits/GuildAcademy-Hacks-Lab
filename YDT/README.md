# YDT Hack

## Running the Simulation

```bash
forge build
forge test --mt test_Exploit -vvv
```

## Incident Overview

Exploit transaction on BSC:
[https://bscscan.com/tx/0x233b21d0355108593c3f136797aed886ae1d4655384b33d67b1fccee88cdfbc2](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x233b21d0355108593c3f136797aed886ae1d4655384b33d67b1fccee88cdfbc2)

Attacker abused `proxyTransfer()` to move tokens from the Pancake LP and swapped them for stablecoins (\~\$41k).

## Vulnerable Function

**Issue:** The check validates the _argument_ `callerModule`, not `msg.sender`. Anyone can pass a whitelisted module address and gain transfer rights.

The require check only checks the address passed in during function call and fails to check if the actual sender is one of the modules.

```solidity
require(
    address(taxModule) == callerModule ||
    address(referralModule) == callerModule ||
    address(deflationModule) == callerModule ||
    address(liquidityModule) == callerModule ||
    address(lpTrackingModule) == callerModule,
    "Only sub-modules allowed"
);
```

In Sentio, We can see the steps that the attacker used to carry out the attack. You can refer to this [**Tx on Sentio**](https://app.sentio.xyz/tx/56/0x233b21d0355108593c3f136797aed886ae1d4655384b33d67b1fccee88cdfbc2?nav=s)

## Attack Path

1. **Use `proxyTransfer()`** to move YDT with super-user validation (module validation address in this case) to the attacker's address.

2. Sync the LP reserves.

3. **Swap YDT â†’ USDT** on PancakeSwap to take profit, as shown by the fund flow section in the image below.

## Post-Mortem Notes

- **Root cause:** Arbitrary address to check authorization instead of `msg.sender`.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Avoid proxy-style transfers that accept arbitrary module addresses.
  - Gate privileged paths with `require(msg.sender == module)` and ensure that address is one of the modules and that msg.sender is actually that module.
