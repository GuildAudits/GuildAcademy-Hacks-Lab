# OpenLeverage Reentrancy Attack Simulation
The April 1, 2024 attack on OpenLeverage protocol that resulted in ~$236K loss due to reentrancy vulnerability.
 
Attack Details:
1. Attacker creates margin position with borrowed funds
2. Calls liquidate function to trigger liquidation process  
3. During WBNB withdrawal, attacker's receive() function is triggered
4. In receive(), attacker calls payoffTrade() while liquidation is still processing
5. payoffTrade() reduces position but doesn't check if liquidation is in progress
6. This allows extraction of more funds than should be possible
  
Root Cause: Missing reentrancy protection in payoffTrade function
Impact: Attacker can extract funds during liquidation process


Here’s a clear summary of the **post-mortem actions** taken after the OpenLeverage exploit (April 1, 2024):

---

### **Post-mortem actions by OpenLeverage protocol**

1. **Protocol Pause**

   * Immediately after detecting the exploit, OpenLeverage **paused lending and margin trading operations** to prevent further abuse.

2. **Compensation Commitment**

   * The team publicly assured users that all losses (\~\$236K) would be **fully compensated** from existing reserves, specifically:

     * the **insurance fund**,
     * the **OLE buyback fund**, and
     * the **protocol treasury**.

3. **Withdrawal Safety Measures**

   * A **safe withdrawal procedure** was introduced, allowing unaffected users to exit positions without risk while the investigation was ongoing.

4. **Bounty Offer to Attacker**

   * OpenLeverage offered the exploiter a **whitehat bounty** incentive to return the stolen assets voluntarily.

5. **Communication and Transparency**

   * The team issued updates through social channels and promised to **share detailed findings** after completing their internal and external audits.

### **Actions by the Security / Research Community**

1. **Incident Analysis**

   * Security firms such as **SlowMist** and **SolidityScan** analyzed the exploit and published detailed breakdowns confirming that the root cause was a **reentrancy flaw** in liquidation/repayment logic.

2. **Transaction & Address Tracking**

   * Researchers traced the attacker’s transactions on **BSCScan**, confirming they were **funded via Tornado Cash** to obscure origins.

3. **Awareness and Knowledge Sharing**

   * Post-incident blogs and reports were released (SlowMist, Immunebytes, community researchers on Reddit/Twitter), highlighting:

     * the exploit path,
     * how reentrancy vulnerabilities in margin protocols can be weaponized,
     * and best practices for preventing similar logic errors.

4. **Tooling Improvement**

   * The exploit was also used as a **case study** for static analysis and fuzzing tools (e.g., Slither, Echidna), strengthening detection rules for reentrancy and liquidation mis-accounting.

---

**In short:** OpenLeverage paused operations, promised compensation, added safe withdrawal measures, and offered a bounty to the hacker. Meanwhile, the security community dissected the exploit, tracked attacker flows, and published lessons learned to improve DeFi auditing practices.
