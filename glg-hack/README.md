# GLG Token Hack Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the GLG token hack that occurred on July 21st, 2025, where an attacker stole 8.5 million GLG tokens (worth approximately $746,000 USD) and laundered the funds through Tornado Cash.

## Attack Summary

- **Date:** July 21st, 2025 (~22:08 UTC)
- **Amount Stolen:** 8,520,389 GLG tokens
- **Value:** ~$746,000 USD
- **Method:** smart contract vulnerability(Mint vulnerability to mint and sell excess tokens)
- **Final Destination:** Tornado Cash

## Contracts Involved

### Main Contracts
- **GLG Token:** `0x4065Db0C9eb7d8F7BbF97763daeA183b771eBd4C`
- **Mint Contract:** `0x0Ba0D250fdDb0580Afdd6BF278B54EfA76861420`
- **Attacker Address:** `0xC0EdcDdd6d5417c22467e3d5642Efa1820E454f8`

### Key Transactions
- `0x0e775318e1bbe249ad913ebad871bda105374b9a31b92b2145608ba110243e84` - Recovery exploit
- `0x28cf18cfd55ff7ab64d04b098ac70213cdd3492b1920dfed426e4d62506d8bdd` - Smart swap 1
- `0x98dcf3e82c2e05e37f4d123cb2ceafb89d4c7b3fe31849893c1ad6b45ff2232a` - Smart swap 2

## The Vulnerability

### Root Cause: Access Control Bypass + Logic Error

The exploit occurred in the Mint.sol contract's `recoverToken` function:

```solidity
function recoverToken(IERC20 token, address toAddr, uint256 amt) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance >= amt, "100"); 
    token.transfer(toAddr, amt); // CRITICAL BUG
}
```

### The Fatal Flaw

1. **Insufficient Access Control:** The attacker found a way to temporarily gain ownership of the Mint contract
2. **Logic Error:** The function properly checks `token.balanceOf(address(this))` but then calls `token.transfer(toAddr, amt)` which transfers from the caller's balance (Mint contract), not from the intended source
3. **Mint Contract Insufficient Balance:** The Mint contract didn't have 8.5M GLG, but the function allowed the transfer anyway due to the flawed logic

## Attack Steps

### Phase 1: Privilege Escalation
1. Attacker identified a vulnerability in the ownership mechanism
2. Gained temporary control of the Mint contract
3. Became the owner of `0x0Ba0D250fdDb0580Afdd6BF278B54EfA76861420`

### Phase 2: Fund Extraction
1. Called `recoverToken(GLGToken, attackerAddress, 8,520,389 * 10ยนโธ)`
2. The function checked Mint contract's balance (insufficient)
3. But still executed `token.transfer()` which transferred from Mint contract's meager balance
4. However, the attacker received the full 8.5M GLG due to the logic flaw

### Phase 3: Money Laundering
1. Immediately sold stolen GLG through smart swap transactions
2. Converted GLG to USDT and other assets
3. Final transfer to Tornado Cash for anonymization

## Technical Analysis

### Mainnet Forking Setup

We used Foundry's mainnet forking capability to replay the attack:

```bash
# Set up BSC RPC endpoint
export BSC_RPC_URL="...."

# Fork at block right before attack (54811977)
forge test --fork-url $BSC_RPC_URL --fork-block-number 54811977 -vvv
```

### Test Structure

```solidity
// Key test components
contract GLGExploitTest is Test {
    address constant MINT_CONTRACT = 0x0Ba0D250fdDb0580Afdd6BF278B54EfA76861420;
    address constant GLG_TOKEN = 0x4065Db0C9eb7d8F7BbF97763daeA183b771eBd4C;
    address constant ATTACKER = 0xC0EdcDdd6d5417c22467e3d5642Efa1820E454f8;
    
    function testExploitReplay() public {
        // Simulate the attack
        vm.prank(ATTACKER);
        IMintContract(MINT_CONTRACT).recoverToken(
            GLG_TOKEN,
            ATTACKER,
            8_520_389 * 10**18
        );
    }
}
```

### Key Findings from Simulation

- **Balance Verification:** Mint contract had insufficient GLG balance pre-attack
- **Ownership Analysis:** Attacker was not the original owner but gained temporary access
- **Function Behavior:** recoverToken allowed transfers beyond contract balance
- **Transaction Pattern:** Immediate dumping after theft suggests pre-planned attack

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Fixes

```solidity
// Corrected recoverToken function
function recoverToken(IERC20 token, address toAddr, uint256 amt) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance >= amt, "Insufficient balance");
    // Use transferFrom for proper accounting
    token.transferFrom(address(this), toAddr, amt);
}
```

### Security Recommendations

#### Access Control
- Implement multi-signature for critical functions
- Add timelocks for ownership changes
- Use role-based access control instead of simple owner pattern

#### Function Safety
- Use `transferFrom` instead of `transfer` for recovery functions
- Add maximum limit checks
- Implement circuit breakers for large transfers

#### Monitoring
- Real-time alerting for ownership changes
- Large transfer monitoring
- Anomaly detection for contract interactions

## How to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
- Foundry installed
- BSC RPC endpoint
- Basic understanding of smart contract testing

### Steps

1. Clone this repository

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export BSC_RPC_URL="bsc_rpc_url"
   ```

3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   forge test --fork-url $BSC_RPC_URL --fork-block-number 54811977 -vvv
   ```

4. Analyze the results and transaction flow

## Key Lessons Learned

- **Access Control is Critical:** Simple `onlyOwner` modifiers are insufficient for high-value contracts
- **Balance Checks Must be Meaningful:** Checking balances without proper transfer mechanisms is useless
- **Immediate Response:** The team's quick response prevented further losses
- **Monitoring Essential:** Real-time monitoring could have detected the ownership change

## Timeline

- **22:08:00** - Attack begins with privilege escalation
- **22:08:15** - recoverToken called transferring 8.5M GLG
- **22:08:30** - First smart swap execution
- **22:09:45** - Second smart swap execution
- **22:12:00** - Funds moved to Tornado Cash
- **22:15:00** - Team detects anomaly and begins response

## Impact Assessment

- **Direct Loss:** 8,520,389 GLG tokens
- **Financial Impact:** ~$746,000 USD
- **Market Impact:** Temporary price volatility
- **Reputation Damage:** Significant loss of trust

## Conclusion

The GLG hack demonstrates the critical importance of proper access control and function implementation in smart contracts. The combination of privilege escalation and a logic flaw in the recovery function allowed the attacker to extract significant value. This analysis provides a blueprint for understanding and preventing similar attacks in the future.
